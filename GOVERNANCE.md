# GOVERNANCE – Semantic Publishing Protocol (SPP)

## Project Stewardship
The Semantic Publishing Protocol is initially maintained and stewarded by Mark Stokes. As the project grows, governance may evolve to include a broader group of contributors and stakeholders.

## Working Group Model
Future development may be guided by a working group model. Anyone interested in the protocol’s evolution may propose the formation of working groups focused on specific areas (e.g., specification, interoperability, responsible AI).

## Proposals and Decision-Making
- **Proposals:** Any contributor may submit a proposal for changes, enhancements, or new directions.
- **Voting:** Decisions are made by simple majority or rough consensus among active maintainers and working group members.
- **Transparency:** All major decisions and discussions will be documented and made available to the community.

## Licensing and Contribution Policies
The project’s open source license and contribution policies must remain consistent unless changed with clear community consent. Any proposed changes to licensing or IP terms require broad agreement and public notice.

This governance model is intended to be flexible and responsive as the community grows. All contributors are encouraged to participate in shaping the future of SPP.
