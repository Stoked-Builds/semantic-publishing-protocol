# Agent Interface (Draft)

## Status
- **Version:** 0.1-draft
- **Stage:** Placeholder (content TBD)
- **Normative:** No (informative only)
- **Dependencies:** SPP-Core

---

## 1. Purpose

The Agent Interface specification defines how **autonomous agents** (browsers, readers, curators, or assistants) interact with the Semantic Publishing Protocol (SPP).  
It will cover:
- Discovery of registries and artifacts
- Querying and filtering of semantic content
- Presentation and navigation models
- Optional user context exchange (preferences, trust anchors)

---

## 2. Roadmap

This file is a placeholder in v0.4.  
Detailed content will be introduced in **v0.5** or later once core registry and peering flows are stable.
