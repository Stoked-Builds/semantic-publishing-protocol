# Intent-Aligned Ads â€“ Specification v0.1

## Purpose [Informative]

This document defines the requirements and structure for intent-aligned advertising in the Semantic Publishing Protocol (SPP). Intent-aligned ads are delivered based on user context, declared preferences, and agent-driven relevance, with a focus on privacy and user control.

---

## Core Concepts [Normative]

- **Intent Matching**: Ads are selected based on explicit user queries, recent activity, and declared interests.
- **Consent-Driven Delivery**: No ad is shown without user or agent consent.
- **Transparent Bidding**: All ad placements are subject to auditable, real-time auctions.
- **Fair Compensation**: Users and publishers are compensated for ad engagement via micro-payments.
