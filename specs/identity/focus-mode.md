# Focus Mode Specification
**Version:** 0.1  
**Status:** Final  
**Date:** 2025-07-28  
**Part of:** [Consent Engine](consent-engine.md) and [SSOT-ID](ssot-id.md)

## 🎯 Purpose

Focus Mode empowers individuals to **minimise digital distractions** during high-priority states such as:
- Deep work
- Emotional regulation
- Mental health rest periods
- Sensory overload or ADHD focus sessions

This spec ensures that **agents, advertisers, and content platforms** respect an individual's declared Focus Mode.

## 🚦 Focus Mode States

| Mode              | Behaviour                                               |
|-------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| `focus.off`       | Normal interaction — no suppression                      |
| `focus.silent`    | Suppress ads and non-essential notifications             |
| `focus.strict`    | Suppress all unsolicited content (ads, news, prompts)    |
| `focus.emergency` | Interrupt only for critical alerts (e.g. health, safety) |

---

## 📡 Declaring Focus Mode

SSOT Agents expose a locally broadcast status:

```json
{
  "ssot_id": "ssot:markstokes",
  "focus_mode": "focus.strict",
  "updated_at": "2025-07-28T08:15:00Z"
}
```

Agents, browsers, and advertisers must check this signal before delivering content.

---

## 🤖 Agent Behaviour Requirements

When `focus_mode` is active:
- Suppress **intent-aligned ads**
- Queue or delay **non-urgent requests**
- Prioritise content from `user_whitelist`
- Refrain from **content-based nudges** (e.g. “You may like…”)

---

## 🔕 Ad Behaviour under Focus Mode

Advertisers must:

- Respect `focus.silent` and above by not delivering ads
- Adjust FARS split logic to account for ad suppression
- Defer ad delivery until user exits focus mode

---

## ✋ Manual Override Support

Users can allow specific apps or agents to bypass focus:

```json
"focus_overrides": [
  "authenticator.app",
  "medication.reminder",
  "becky.messenger"
]
```

---

## 🔍 Verification

Focus mode signals:
- Must not be spoofable or injectable from external agents
- Must originate from the user’s own SSOT Agent or signed device
- May be relayed via encrypted local mesh for multi-device use

---

## 🔐 Privacy Guarantee

Focus mode status is shared **only locally** or with explicitly consented agents.  
Public content platforms and advertisers must **poll, not push**.  
No central storage or tracking of focus mode is allowed.

---

## 🛠 Roadmap

- Smart device integrations (wearables, mixed reality)
- Dynamic focus triggers (e.g. calendar, cortisol level, ambient noise)
- Visual badge in AI browser UI
- Local “focus history” for journaling + pattern recognition

---

Focus Mode is a cornerstone of the **sovereign attention economy**.  
It protects the user's right to peace, clarity, and focus —  
...and demands respect from every layer of the digital ecosystem.
