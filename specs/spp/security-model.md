# Security Model â€“ Semantic Publishing Protocol (SPP)

This document outlines the security principles, threat mitigations, and best practices for the SPP ecosystem. It is intended to guide implementers, auditors, and contributors in building secure, privacy-respecting systems.

## 1. Security Principles

- **User Sovereignty**: Users retain full control over their identity, consent, and data sharing.
- **Least Privilege**: Agents, services, and adapters operate with the minimum permissions required.
- **Transparency**: All actions, consent grants, and payments are auditable by the user.
- **Decentralization**: No single point of failure or control; registries and agents are federated or user-hosted.
- **Privacy by Design**: Personal data is local-first, encrypted, and shared only with explicit consent.

## 2. Threat Model

- **Identity Theft**: Mitigated by SSOT-ID, DID, and cryptographic signatures. See [SSOT-ID](../identity/ssot-id.md).
- **Consent Forgery**: All consent tokens are signed and verifiable. See [Consent Engine](../identity/consent-engine.md).
- **Payment Fraud**: Payment adapters require user consent and cryptographic receipts. See [Micro-Payments](../payments/micro-payments.md).
- **Sybil Attacks**: Trust and reputation are multi-sourced and weighted by verified signals. See [Trust Engine](../consent-engine/trust-engine.md).
- **Data Leakage**: Agents and browsers must not leak private context across domains or tasks. See [Agent Behaviour](./agent-behaviour.md).
- **Registry Poisoning**: Registries validate publisher signatures and support audit trails. See [Publishing Registry](./publishing-registry.md).

---

## 3. Best Practices

- Use strong cryptographic primitives for all signatures and receipts.
- Rotate keys and credentials regularly; support revocation.
- Log all consent, payment, and trust events for user audit.
- Validate all external data and registry entries before use.
- Implement rate limiting and anomaly detection for agents and adapters.
- Provide clear user interfaces for reviewing and revoking consent, payments, and agent permissions.

---

## 4. Future Considerations

- Zero-knowledge proofs for privacy-preserving consent and payments.
- Decentralized registry consensus and dispute resolution.
- Automated threat intelligence sharing between registries and agents.
- Formal verification of critical protocol flows.
