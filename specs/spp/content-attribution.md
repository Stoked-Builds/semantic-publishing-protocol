# Content Attribution Specification (v0.1)

## Purpose

This document defines how content authorship, ownership, licensing, and contribution are attributed in the Semantic Publishing Protocol (SPP). It enables transparent tracking of provenance, fair compensation, and enforceable usage rights.

---

## 1. Attribution Block

Every published semantic content unit (e.g. article, product, video, dataset) should include a machine-readable attribution block:

```json
{
  "title": "string",
  "author": {
    "name": "string",
    "id": "DID or public key"
  },
  "contributors": [
    {
      "name": "string",
      "id": "DID or public key",
      "role": "editor | translator | co-author | other"
    }
  ],
  "publisher": "string (optional)",
  "license": "SPDX identifier or custom string",
  "source_url": "canonical link to original content",
  "date_published": "ISO 8601",
  "version": "semantic versioning (optional)"
}
```

This block must be made available alongside the content metadata and registry entry.

---

## 2. Licensing

Supported license types:
- SPDX-compliant licenses (e.g. `CC-BY-4.0`, `MIT`, `Apache-2.0`)
- Custom licenses with a published terms URL
- No license (default: all rights reserved, not indexable)

Licenses can define:
- Commercial use rights
- AI re-use rights
- Attribution requirements
- Derivative works allowance

---

## 3. Author Verification

Authors may optionally sign content with their private key to allow verifiable authorship and timestamping. This enables:
- Proof-of-origin
- Anti-plagiarism detection
- Content dispute resolution

The signature can be embedded via a `signature` property in the attribution block or linked in the registry.

---

## 4. Attribution in AI-Generated Content

When content is generated by AI:
- The agent identity must be declared
- The user who prompted or instructed the agent is listed as `initiator`
- The training data or foundation model (if relevant) can be optionally included

```json
{
  "generated_by": "agent_id",
  "initiator": "user_id",
  "model": "gpt-4o",
  "source_context": "hash or doc ref (optional)"
}
```

---

## 5. Multi-source Attribution

Content aggregated from multiple sources must include a `sources` array and use weighted attribution if feasible:

```json
"sources": [
  {
    "title": "string",
    "url": "string",
    "weight": 0.45
  }
]
```

---

## 6. Display and Enforcement

Consumers (browsers, agents) are expected to:
- Display author and license info where appropriate
- Honour usage restrictions defined in the license
- Respect `no-index`, `no-scrape`, or attribution-required tags in headers

Violations can be reported through the consent engine or flagged via the reputation system.

---

## 7. Future Extensions

- Micro-royalty support for licensed fragments
- Author revenue sharing on AI remix or summarisation
- Live attribution updates via trust-linked registries
