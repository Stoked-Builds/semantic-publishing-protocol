- **Attribution**: The process of crediting authors, publishers, or contributors for content or actions within the protocol.

## B

- **BlockRef**: A field or reference pointing to another semantic block by its unique identifier, enabling modular composition and traceability.

## C

- **Consent Engine**: The component responsible for managing user consent, preferences, and data sharing policies.
- **Content Block**: A modular, self-contained unit of structured content, such as a recipe, review, or product listing.

## D

## R

- **Registry**: A decentralized or federated directory of agents, publishers, or content blocks, supporting discovery and verification.

## S

- **Semantic Block**: See Content Block.
- **Single Source of Truth (SSOT)**: A globally unique, resolvable identifier (e.g., `ssot://`) for identity and attribution.
- **SPP Token (SPX)**: The native or planned token for micro-payments and incentive alignment in the protocol.
- **Split**: A revenue or royalty allocation among multiple recipients, defined in content or registry metadata.
