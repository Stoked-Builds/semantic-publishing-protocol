# Review Chain Protocol

**File:** `specs/publishing/review-chain.md`  
**Status:** Draft v0.1  
**SPP Component:** Trust / Attribution / Publishing

---

## Purpose

Establish a **cryptographically-verifiable trail** of edits, reviews, and contributions for published content. Ideal for collaborative documents, journalism, AI-generated reports, or scientific articles.

---

## Core Principles

- **Transparency**: Every change or contributor is tracked
- **Verifiability**: Signatures and timestamps validate history
- **Flexibility**: Review chains are optional and can be partial

---

## Record Structure

Each record includes:

```json
{
  "content_hash": "abc123...",
  "actor_id": "agent://reviewer.jlee",
  "role": "editor",
  "action": "modified",
  "timestamp": "2025-07-28T17:32:00Z",
  "signature": "xyz789..."
}
```

---

## Supported Actions

| Action     | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| `created`  | Initial content post |
| `modified` | Text or metadata change |
