# RESPONSIBLE AI PRINCIPLES – Semantic Publishing Protocol (SPP)

## Statement of Intent
The Semantic Publishing Protocol is designed to empower ethical, transparent, and trustworthy AI workflows. Our goal is to enable open, user-centric publishing that respects the rights and dignity of all participants—human and machine.

## Prohibited Uses
- **Disinformation:** Do not use SPP to create, distribute, or amplify false or misleading information.
- **Surveillance:** Do not use SPP to surveil individuals or track personal activity without explicit, informed consent.
- **Manipulation:** Do not use SPP to manipulate, coerce, or exploit users or audiences without their knowledge and agreement.

## Commitment to Openness and Inclusion
We encourage open innovation, inclusion, and accessibility in all SPP implementations. The protocol is intended to support diverse voices, equitable participation, and broad access to knowledge.

## Guidance for Future Contributors
- **AI Fairness:** Strive to identify and mitigate bias in AI-driven publishing and content processing.
- **Privacy Controls:** Build in privacy protections and give users meaningful control over their data and consent.
- **Transparency:** Document AI decision-making and make workflows auditable wherever possible.
