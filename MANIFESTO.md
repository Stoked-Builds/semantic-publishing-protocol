# MANIFESTO: The Semantic Publishing Protocol

## The Web Is Dying

The open web is suffocating under the weight of algorithmic exploitation. Every day, another independent creator gets throttled. Every search becomes a graveyard of SEO spam. Every click feeds a machine that strips meaning from human expression and packages it as commodity data.

This isn't the internet dying of natural causes. This is murder.

Giant platforms have turned the web into a series of walled gardens where they control discovery, monetization, and even basic reach. They've weaponized algorithms to make creators beg for scraps of attention to their own audiences. They've made the fundamental act of linking—the web's core promise—into a liability.

The web was built to be decentralized. We let it become feudal.

## Platforms Eat Creators

Every platform follows the same playbook: attract creators with promises of reach and revenue, then slowly turn the screws. 

Twitter throttles external links. Facebook buries organic reach. YouTube changes monetization rules overnight. TikTok decides what goes viral based on opaque corporate interests. Search engines prioritize their own properties over the actual web.

Meanwhile, AI companies strip-mine decades of human creativity without permission, consent, or compensation. They hoover up every blog post, every article, every creative work—then resell our collective intelligence back to us as "artificial."

Creators get nothing. Platforms get everything. The middle class of content is being systematically eliminated.

**This isn't innovation. This is digital colonialism.**

## AI Needs Open Standards

We're building the most powerful information processing systems in human history on a foundation of hacks, guesswork, and theft.

AI agents scrape messy HTML and pray they extracted the right meaning. LLMs are trained on mountains of unlabeled, unattributed content ripped from contexts that matter. Every "smart" system is actually dumb—constantly reverse-engineering intent from fragments of broken web infrastructure.

Meanwhile, creators have no way to opt in or out of AI training. No way to maintain attribution. No way to share in the value their work creates when it powers the next breakthrough model.

The current approach doesn't scale. It doesn't respect creators. It doesn't even work that well.

**We need protocols, not platforms. Standards, not strip-mining.**

## Why SPP Exists

The Semantic Publishing Protocol is the counter-move.

SPP gives creators a way to publish content that carries its own meaning, context, and licensing terms wherever it goes. No more guessing games for AI. No more broken attribution chains. No more helplessly watching your work disappear into algorithmic black holes.

With SPP, you publish once and everything that needs to understand your content—search engines, AI agents, aggregators, readers—gets clean, structured, unambiguous information about what you created, when, and under what terms.

This isn't just better metadata. This is taking back control.

**SPP makes creators sovereign again.** Your content becomes a live API that machines can subscribe to, process, and act on—but only with your permission and according to your rules. When an AI agent uses your work, the attribution flows back to you automatically. When someone builds on your ideas, the connection is preserved.

We're not trying to destroy the platforms. We're building the infrastructure to make them irrelevant.

The web doesn't need to be fixed. It needs to be rebuilt—semantically, contextually, and cooperatively. The future belongs to creators who own their distribution, readers who control their attention, and AI that respects both.

**Join the revolution. Publish semantically. Own your future.**
