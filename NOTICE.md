# NOTICE – Attribution and Naming Guidelines

## Attribution for Reuse
If you reuse, adapt, or build upon the Semantic Publishing Protocol (SPP) specification or related materials, please provide clear attribution to the original project and authors. Include a reference to the official repository and acknowledge any substantial changes you make.

## Naming Rules
You may not name your product, service, or implementation “Semantic Publishing Protocol,” “Stoked Protocol,” or any confusingly similar name. These names are reserved for the official specification and project.

## Project Names and Trademarks
The terms “Semantic Publishing Protocol” and “Semantic Publishing Specification” are associated with this repository and its maintainers. These names may be trademarked in the future. Please respect these identifiers and do not use them in a way that implies official status or endorsement.

## Forks and Derived Works
You are welcome to refer to, implement, or fork the protocol. However, you must make it clear that your project is a derived work and not the official SPP or Stoked Protocol. Please include a notice in your documentation stating the relationship to the original project.
