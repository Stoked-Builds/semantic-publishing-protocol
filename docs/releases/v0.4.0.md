# Release Notes — SPP v0.4.0

## Overview

This release introduces **mandatory provenance, signatures, plugin isolation, and peering guardrails**. It strengthens the integrity of artifacts and the resilience of the peering network.

## Key Changes

- **Provenance & Signatures**
  - Every Artifact includes `registry_id`, `adapter_id`, `collected_at`, `content_hash`, and `signatures[]`.
  - JCS canonicalisation required; Ed25519 signatures recommended.
  - Inline endorsements supported.

- **Trust Scoring**
  - Weighted, asymmetric decay with probation for new peers.
  - Daily movement caps; endorsements from long-trusted registries carry higher weight.

- **Cross-Peer Corroboration**
  - New `/api/peer/lookup` endpoint.
  - Peers below threshold require corroboration from ≥2 trusted registries.

- **Plugin Security**
  - Mandatory containerisation, egress allowlists, and least-privilege design.
  - Plugins emit only `ArtifactDraft`.

- **Registry Identity**
  - `registry_id` must be a valid domain with DNS TXT or `.well-known` key proof.
  - JWKS exposure and rotation rules defined.

## Migration

- Update artifacts to use `signatures[]` instead of `signature`.
- Add provenance fields (`registry_id`, `adapter_id`, `collected_at`).
- Enforce plugin isolation for all adapters.
- Implement trust scoring and corroboration before re-sharing artifacts.
