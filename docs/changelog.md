### Highlights
- 📦 Stable release of v0.2.x branch
- 🔧 Restructured and modularised all specs under `specs/`
- 🧪 Rich example set added in `/examples`, covering:
  - Stories with semantic blocks
  - Semantic sitemaps
  - Consent tokens, review chains, endorsements
- ✅ Schema definitions and working validation examples in `/schema`
- 📚 Spec index and spec hierarchy added to aid navigation
- 🔄 Includes semantic-sitemap, semantic-blocks, consent-engine, agent-interface, and browser extensions

### Notes
- This release freezes the `v0.2.x` structure before we begin breaking changes in `v0.3`.
