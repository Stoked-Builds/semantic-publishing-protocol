The proposal enables valuable artifact enrichment and versioned provenance visibility that significantly improve the system's transparency and analytic capabilities, key for innovation. They mitigate bias risks by requiring enrichment metadata such as 'generator_id' and a 'portable' flag, but do not fully address user consent or control of enriched personal or AI-derived data. Storage cost mitigations for snapshots defer to implementation, yet privacy and regulatory controls around data retention, auditability, and deletion eligibility remain unspecified, raising GDPR and ethical compliance concerns. Without explicit privacy, traceability, and user redress mechanisms, this upgrade risks undermining trust. Hence, conditional approval with blockers is advised to ensure ethical safeguards are built into the schema and registry workflows before broader implementation.
