The Review Board convened on the proposal to upgrade the artifact schema with enrichment, timeline, and standardized preview/attachment capabilities. Advocates highlighted the necessity for richer metadata to support smarter discovery and federation use cases, emphasizing that the additive approach preserves backward compatibility for existing consumers. Risk mitigation strategies were scrutinized; the inclusion of a portable flag for AI insights and provision for migration scripts were recognized as strong safeguards. Concerns about schema bloat and storage costs were raised but deemed manageable through optional fields and external cold storage references. No significant ethical or financial concerns blocked approval; the Ethics & Finance personas concurred that scores met thresholds with well-justified mitigations. Consequently, the board grants approval conditioned on diligent implementation and monitoring as listed in recommended actions. The decision aligns with the mission to protect protocol integrity by avoiding incompatible forks, sustain organizational capacity via clear migration paths, and enable responsible adoption of advanced artifact capabilities. No dissenting votes were recorded.
