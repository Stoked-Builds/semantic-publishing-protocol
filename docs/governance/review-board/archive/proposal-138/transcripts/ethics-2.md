This proposal to extend artifact schemas with enrichment, timeline, and preview structures supports improved auditability and richer metadata capabilities. The inclusion of provenance metadata fields addressing AI bias is a strong ethical control, enhancing transparency across registries. Allowing downstream systems to ignore unknown optional fields limits disruption for minimal clients. However, critical ethics components are currently deferred or vague: user consent for enrichment data use is not detailed, nor are audit or redress mechanisms for data corrections or disputes. There is risk that enriched AI annotations may propagate bias without robust user control or accountability measures. Additionally, storage of snapshot data via external URIs demands clear data retention and deletion policies to comply with regulations like GDPR. Before approving, the board must see concrete plans for consent management, audit trails, data deletion rights, and legal reviews to safeguard user privacy, fairness, and oversight. Without these controls, the proposal poses moderate ethical risks despite its technical benefits.
