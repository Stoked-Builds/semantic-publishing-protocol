The proposal strategically differentiates Punk Forge/SPP by enabling deterministic, audit-capable artifact enrichment that incumbents lack in a non-breaking manner, ensuring minimal disruption while enhancing functionality. Architecturally, the reuse of a vanilla namespace and additive optional fields respects composability and forward compatibility, mitigating risks of forks and schema fragmentation. The timeline inclusion enables provenance tracking and historical reindexing vital for trust and discovery automation, while the standard preview/attachment schema reduces developer guesswork, directly accelerating publisher workflows. Rejecting this proposal risks stagnation by locking out advanced metadata use-cases like AI annotation portability and historical audits, which are increasingly critical. Opportunity cost is low given no superior alternative innovation is competing for immediate priority, and this lays foundational infrastructure for richer semantic publishing capabilities.
