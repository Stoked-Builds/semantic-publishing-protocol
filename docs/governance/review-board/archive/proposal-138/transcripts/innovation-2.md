This proposal significantly advances artifact schema with enrichment, timeline, and preview attachments, enabling richer, auditable metadata without breaking backward compatibility. The mitigation strategies thoughtfully include a 'portable' flag and model provenance fields to reduce AI bias propagation risks. However, the dossier does not present explicit consent management or PII data minimisation controls, raising ethical concerns about user privacy and long-term governance. Effective privacy safeguards and accountability mechanisms must be embedded in the schema and implementation plans before approval, ensuring compliance with GDPR and preventing abuse, such as unauthorized AI profiling or storage bloat of sensitive data. Overall, the initiative is promising but requires clearly defined controls and transparency features to move forward ethically.
