This proposal offers a well-justified evolutionary leap by systematically including enrichment metadata, event timelines, and preview payloads within the artifact schema's vanilla namespace. This keeps backward compatibility and eases adoption paths for downstream consumers, addressing key architectural principles of composability and forward-compatibility. The addition of a 'portable' flag and strict provenance attribution anticipates AI bias risks while enabling federated enrichment reuse, a novel protocol primitive with strong future-proofing potential. By defining fixed contracts for deterministic preview and attachment payloads, the protocol reduces ad-hoc extensions and variability that impede ecosystem growth. The enclosed mitigation plans for schema bloat, migration, and storage overhead reflect thoughtful risk management. Rejecting this update risks ecosystem stagnation by locking artifacts into immutable, non-enrichable forms that limit innovation in automated content classification, provenance auditability, and media rendering, all crucial for semantic publishing workflows and discovery acceleration. While ambitious, the proposal prioritizes incremental rollout and backward compatibility, mitigating disruption and abdicates no other more impactful innovations. Thus, from an innovation standpoint, the proposal merits strong endorsement.
