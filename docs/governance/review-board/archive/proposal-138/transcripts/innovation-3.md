This proposal notably strengthens the protocol's strategic differentiation by introducing a structured, portable enrichment layer that supports AI annotations and provenance timelines—features absent in the current minimal artifact schema. Architecturally, the additive approach respects backward compatibility through optional fields and a minor schema bump (0.5), thus preventing stagnation risks tied to schema rigidity. By standardizing previews and attachments, it also reduces ad-hoc client logic, streamlining developer workflows around artifact visualization and indexing.

Risks such as AI bias leakage and schema bloat are thoughtfully mitigated with flags and optional nullability, and the migration path is well scoped to maintain protocol health and interoperability. From an innovation perspective, enabling timeline-based snapshots and provenance records unlocks future federation capabilities and richer graph queries, which are valuable for the ecosystem’s evolution. Rejecting this might stall key foundational capabilities, risking premature forks and limiting downstream automation and discovery.

Given the well-articulated design, mitigation strategies, and alignment with registry operators, this proposal aligns strongly with the mission hierarchy. It balances technical feasibility, ecosystem growth, and forward-compatible design in a manner that significantly pushes the protocol beyond its current state. No critical blockers are identified; next steps should focus on coordinated implementation and adoption support.
