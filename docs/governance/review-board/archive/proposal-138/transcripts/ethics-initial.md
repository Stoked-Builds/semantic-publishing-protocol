This proposal elevates artifact schema capability with enrichment, timeline, and preview features, supporting auditability and AI-driven metadata enrichment while maintaining backward compatibility. The inclusion of a portable flag and detailed model metadata aligns with bias mitigation and transparency best practices. However, no comprehensive privacy or consent mechanisms are present for enrichment data, potentially exposing Personally Identifiable Information (PII) or proprietary details without user control. Storage referencing external URIs mitigates storage bloat but necessitates clear data governance to avoid uncontrolled data retention or abuse. Overall, ethically acceptable but conditionally, pending formal privacy, consent, and audit controls integrated into implementation.
