*Published: January 15, 2025 | Updated: 4:45 PM UTC*

World leaders announced an unprecedented $75 billion global agreement on carbon capture technology funding and deployment at the COP30 climate summit today, marking a significant step forward in international climate cooperation.

The agreement, reached after intense negotiations, establishes a framework for accelerated development and deployment of carbon capture, utilization, and storage (CCUS) technologies across participating nations.

## Key Details

The funding package includes:
- $30 billion for research and development of next-generation carbon capture technologies
- $25 billion for infrastructure development in developing nations
- $20 billion for technology transfer and capacity building programs

"This represents the largest coordinated international investment in carbon capture technology in history," said EU Climate Commissioner Maria Santos. "We're not just talking about the future anymore â€“ we're building it."

## Breaking: Major Developing Nations Join Agreement

In a dramatic turn of events, China and India announced their participation in the agreement this afternoon, bringing the total number of participating countries to 47 and adding an additional $15 billion in committed funding.

The inclusion of these major economies significantly expands the global reach and potential impact of the initiative, addressing earlier criticism that the agreement lacked participation from key developing nations.

## Implementation Timeline

The agreement establishes a phased implementation approach:

**Phase 1 (2025-2027)**: Research infrastructure and pilot projects
- Establishment of 15 international research centers
- Launch of 50 demonstration projects globally

**Phase 2 (2028-2030)**: Scale-up and deployment
- Commercial deployment of proven technologies
- Technology transfer to developing nations

**Phase 3 (2031-2035)**: Full implementation
- Target deployment of 500 large-scale CCUS facilities globally
- Achievement of 2 gigatons of annual CO2 capture capacity

The agreement is expected to be formally signed tomorrow, with implementation beginning immediately upon ratification by participating governments.
