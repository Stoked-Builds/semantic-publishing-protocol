# validate.n8n

ðŸ§ª This is a placeholder for a visual n8n workflow to:

1. Read all folders under `/examples/stories/`
2. Load and parse each `story.md`
3. Extract frontmatter and generate digest
4. Validate against `semantic.json` and `topics.json`
5. Output pass/fail status to Telegram or Webhook

Use this as a base for workflow automation in a self-hosted n8n instance.
