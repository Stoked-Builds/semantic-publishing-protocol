---

Every day, more of the open web is being swallowed by walled gardens, algorithmic sludge, and AI engines that strip-mine meaning but give nothing back.

Creators lose traffic. Publishers lose revenue. Readers lose context.  
And the web becomes a shallow pool of recycled noise ‚Äî increasingly unreadable, unfollowable, and untrustworthy.

**SPP is a new publishing standard for a very different future.**  
It lets content be discovered, reconstructed, trusted, and *understood* ‚Äî by both humans and machines ‚Äî without sacrificing ownership, context, or provenance.

---

## üß† What It Actually Does

SPP is a decentralised, AI-native content protocol that turns passive web pages into active, intelligent, and self-defending artifacts. It makes your content:

- üß† **Machine-readable** ‚Äî ready to be reconstructed and reused by any AI, without guessing
- üîê **Owner-verifiable** ‚Äî no more scraping, no more theft; attribution is built in
- üß≠ **Context-aware** ‚Äî agents know where, when, and why something was published
- ü§ù **Endorseable & trustable** ‚Äî with signals from real humans, not black-box algorithms

It‚Äôs RSS with a brain. JSON-LD with attitude. ActivityPub that actually works.

---

## üîì What This Unlocks

SPP isn‚Äôt just a spec. It‚Äôs a rebellion in structured form.

**For Creators & Publishers:**  
Your content becomes a live, verifiable data stream. AI agents can subscribe, remix it (with credit), and even pay you ‚Äî no more platform middlemen. You own the whole journey.

**For Developers & AI Engineers:**  
Stop scraping brittle HTML. Stop reverse-engineering meaning. With SPP, you get clean, structured truth you can build on ‚Äî whether you're feeding LLMs, powering dashboards, or creating agentic assistants.

**For Everyone Else:**  
This is the way back to a web that works for us. A web where trust is built in, credit flows to the source, and discovery is driven by *meaning*, not manipulation.

> Stop begging platforms for scraps. Start owning the conversation.

---

## üß† Micro-Example: How It Feels

Instead of publishing a messy HTML page and hoping an AI interprets it right, you publish this:

```json
{
  "claim": "The current interest rate is 5.25%",
  "source": "entity:federal-reserve-announcement-123",
  "published_at": "2025-08-07T14:00:00Z"
}
```

Now any AI agent can subscribe to your feed and *know*, with certainty and provenance, what the interest rate is.  
No scraping. No guessing. Just truth.

---

## ‚è≥ Why This Matters Now

We‚Äôre at a fork in the road.

The open web is collapsing into a graveyard of dead links, ghost-town blogs, and SEO-choked clickbait.  
Platforms throttle external links. AI models regurgitate without credit. Search is broken. Social is worse.  
You feel it every time you publish something meaningful ‚Äî and it vanishes into the void.

**SPP is the counter-move.**  
It lets content carry its own meaning, provenance, and context ‚Äî wherever it goes.

We can either keep patching the broken system...  
Or we can teach the web to speak for itself ‚Äî semantically, contextually, and unambiguously.

> The future of the web doesn‚Äôt need a new platform.  
> It needs a protocol.

## Versioning

SPP follows [Semantic Versioning 2.0.0](https://semver.org/) to ensure predictable updates and backward compatibility.

### Protocol Version

All SPP metadata includes a `protocolVersion` field that indicates which version of the protocol the content follows:

```json
{
  "protocolVersion": "1.0.0",
  "id": "example-content",
  "title": "Example Content"
}
```

### Version Format

- **MAJOR**: Incremented for breaking changes that require content updates
- **MINOR**: Incremented for backward-compatible feature additions
- **PATCH**: Incremented for backward-compatible bug fixes

### Compatibility

- Content published with protocol version `1.x.x` will remain compatible within the `1.x` series
- Agents and validators should gracefully handle minor version differences
- Major version changes may require content migration or updates

---

## üì¶ Installation

Install the Dope Drop Protocol CLI globally to get started:

```bash
npm install -g dope-drop-protocol
```

This will give you access to the `dope-drop` command from anywhere on your system.

### Quick Start

1. **Initialize a new semantic project:**
   ```bash
   dope-drop init
   ```
   This creates a `semantic.json` template file with all required fields.

2. **Edit your content:**
   Open `semantic.json` and customize it with your content details, author information, and content body.

3. **Validate your semantic file:**
   ```bash
   dope-drop validate semantic.json
   ```
   Or validate all semantic files in the current directory:
   ```bash
   dope-drop validate
   ```

### Commands

- **`dope-drop init [options]`** - Initialize a new semantic publishing project
  - `-o, --output <file>` - Output file name (default: semantic.json)

- **`dope-drop validate [files...]`** - Validate semantic publishing protocol files
  - `-s, --schema-dir <dir>` - Custom schema directory path
  - `-v, --verbose` - Verbose output with detailed validation reports
  - `--extensions-only` - Only check extensions, skip schema validation

### Examples

```bash
# Create a new semantic content file
dope-drop init -o my-article.json

# Validate specific files
dope-drop validate article1.json article2.json

# Validate with verbose output
dope-drop validate semantic.json --verbose

# Validate all common semantic files in current directory
dope-drop validate
```

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Developer Tools

### Drop Scaffold Generator

Create new drop sites with schema-compliant metadata using the `dope-drop` CLI:

```bash
# Create a new blog site
dope-drop init mysite --type blog

# Create a new zine site  
dope-drop init myzine --type zine

# Create a new recipes site
dope-drop init myrecipes --type recipes
```

This will create:
- `<sitename>/site.config.json` with valid site metadata
- `<sitename>/pubs/first/meta.jsonld` with schema-compliant publication metadata
- Directory structure ready for content publishing

The generated files pass validation and include starter content appropriate for each site type.

### Validation CLI

Use the built-in validation tool to check your drop metadata files against their JSON Schemas:

```bash
# Validate all site.config.json and pubs/**/meta.jsonld files
npm run validate

# Or run directly
node scripts/validate.js

# Validate specific files
node scripts/validate.js path/to/site.config.json path/to/meta.jsonld
```

The validator will:
- ‚úÖ Print "All files pass validation" on success (exit code 0)
- ‚ùå Print "Validation failed" with detailed error information on failure (exit code 1)
- Show schema keyword, data path, and error message for each validation error

Works cross-platform (macOS/Linux/Windows) and is suitable for CI/CD pipelines.
