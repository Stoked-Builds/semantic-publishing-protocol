# 🕸️ The Semantic Publishing Protocol (SPP)

> ✨ A modular, agent-aware, AI-native standard to make the web speak again — with memory, meaning, and consent.

## 🔥 Imagine This

You open your browser — and the **entire web reshapes itself around you**.

- Every page tailors its layout, content, and logic to *your* preferences.
- Ads? They're made for you. And when you engage, **you get paid**.
- AI agents don’t just read pages. They **collaborate** with them — intelligently, contextually, respectfully.

> This isn’t the future. This is what the **Semantic Publishing Protocol (SPP)** enables.

## 😬 But There’s a Catch

AI agents are **devouring the web** without giving back.

📉 Page views are dropping.  
💸 Ad revenue is vanishing.  
🧠 AI is learning… but creators are starving.  
We call this the **AI Starvation Loop**.

> Left unchecked, it will collapse the content economy — and take AI quality down with it.

## 🧩 So We Built a Fix

SPP gives the web a **semantic nervous system**:

✅ **Agent-aware content**: Machines know what they’re reading — and how to behave  
✅ **Memory**: Pages and agents share context (ethically and transparently)  
✅ **Consent and attribution**: Users and creators stay in control  
✅ **Monetisation hooks**: Embed revenue rules, track engagement, reward participation

It’s not just a protocol — it’s a new **economic and semantic contract** between humans, AI, and the web.

## 🛠️ Try It

### 🧪 [Run the Validator](#)
Validate content against the SPP schema and see what machines will understand.

### 🔍 [Explore Semantic Markup](#)
Compare regular HTML vs. SPP-enhanced artefacts.

## 🚀 Why This Matters

The current web was built for **humans with eyeballs**.

But the new web — the one being read by AI — needs **meaning, memory, and boundaries**.

SPP is the protocol that makes that shift not only possible… but survivable.

## 📚 What’s Inside

- `spec/` – Formal spec documents (modular, evolving)
- `examples/` – Real content using SPP markup
- `validator/` – Source code for the semantic validator
- `docs/` – Intro guides, vision, and reasoning
