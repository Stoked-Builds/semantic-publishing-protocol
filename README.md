# Semantic Publishing Protocol

> I taught the Web to speak.

The Semantic Publishing Protocol (SPP) is a decentralised, AI-native content standard designed for a new era of agentic systems, contextual browsers, and dynamic media experiences.

It allows content to be **machine-native**, **owner-verifiable**, and **context-aware**—without relying on centralised platforms.
