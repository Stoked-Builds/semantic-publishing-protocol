# SPP Validator Tool (Scaffold)

This document describes the planned `spp-validator` tool for the Semantic Publishing Protocol (SPP). The tool will provide schema validation, compliance checking, and best-practice enforcement for SPP content, metadata, and protocol flows.

---

## Purpose
- Validate SPP content blocks, registry entries, and agent metadata against official schemas.
- Check for required fields, correct types, and cross-spec compliance.
- Help implementers and publishers ensure their data is SPP-compliant before publishing or registry submission.

---

## Planned Features
- JSON Schema validation for all major SPP object types (see [Semantic Publishing Specification](../specs/sps/semantic-publishing-specification.md)).
- CLI and/or web interface for uploading and checking files.
- Error reporting with actionable feedback and links to relevant specs.
- Extensible plugin system for custom checks and future protocol versions.

---

## Roadmap
- [ ] Define and publish JSON Schemas for all SPP object types.
- [ ] Implement core validation logic (CLI, API, or web UI).
- [ ] Integrate with SPP registries and publishing workflows.
- [ ] Add support for custom extensions and adapters.
