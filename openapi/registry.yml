    Semantic Publishing Protocol Registry API for discovery, claims, adoption, 
    federation, transparency logs, and ownership management.
    
    This is a HTTP/DNS-native registry (no blockchain) that stores and serves 
    SPP artifacts with provenance states: reconstructed → claimed → adopted → authoritative.
