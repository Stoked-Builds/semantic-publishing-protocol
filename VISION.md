# VISION: The Semantic Publishing Protocol (SPP)

**The web is broken for AI.** Today, intelligent agents and applications are forced to scrape, parse, and guess their way through oceans of unstructured content. Every search engine, chatbot, and automation pipeline is built atop fragile hacks—extracting meaning from HTML, inferring intent from contextless blobs, and hoping the next update doesn’t break everything. This is not a foundation for the future.

**We need a new protocol.** The world’s information deserves to be natively machine-readable, not retrofitted for AI as an afterthought. We need publishing standards that encode context, intent, and trust directly into the content layer—so that both humans and machines can discover, remix, and act on knowledge with confidence.

**The Semantic Publishing Protocol (SPP) changes the game.** SPP is an open, extensible protocol for publishing, subscribing to, and routing content that is semantically structured from the start. With SPP, AI agents don’t scrape—they subscribe. They don’t guess—they process, validate, and act on content that is designed for them. Every document, update, and event is routed with meaning, attribution, and consent built in.

**Imagine the future:**

- An AI builds a real-time dashboard for your team, automatically aggregating and summarizing the latest research, news, and data from trusted SPP sources.
- Another agent watches your blog for new document submissions, instantly analyzes them for relevance, and replies with a personalized report or next steps.
- Human creators and AI agents co-author, review, and publish content—each action tracked, attributed, and open for remixing or audit.

**This is an inflection point.** For the first time, we can build a web where context, relevance, and action are encoded in the content itself—not lost in translation. SPP is the foundation for a new era of human-machine publishing: open, trusted, and alive with possibility.

**Join us.** Help build a web where every document is an API, every agent is a collaborator, and every user is in control. The future of publishing is semantic, and it starts now.
